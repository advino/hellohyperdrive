# Hello Hyperdrive

Simple p2p filesystem using Hyperdrive. Import files from a folder and distribute them over p2p via Hyperdrive. Includes real-time watching, syncing, and downloading of files.

This is part of series of p2p exercises to build applications using the Hypercore Protocol. There are two versions of this repo, one where I use Hyperswarm only and another where I use Hyperswarms `Replicator` library to speed things up. It all depends on how deep you want to go with Hypercore Protocol.
